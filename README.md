Object orientation in Python
===

In this tutorial we are going to play around with classes and objects in Python.
We will create a class with several methods and attributes, analyze it carefully and see important differences between class attributes and instance attributes. 
To write Python commands we will use the plain Python Interpreter.


Getting started
---
In this tutorial will use Python 2.7, although if you have any other version it is also fine. The Python Interpreter we will be using comes with the installer. If you don't have Python on your machine follow the steps below, otherwise you can skip this section.
More experienced users might also want to work with [IPython](http://ipython.org/install.html), an interactive console, which offers additional functionality such as tab completion, inspection of the namespace, inline help and much more. 


For **Windows** users the most convenient way to get Python is to download installers from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/download/). Depending on your operating system type, you will need either a 32-bit or 64-bit version of the installer.
If you're unsure which version to download, you can find the information by right clicking on `My Computer` and `Properties` in Windows. If you have a 32-bit processor get the `Python 2.7.6 Windows Installer` and if it's 64-bit the `Python 2.7.6 Windows X86-64 Installer`.

**Mac** and **Linux** users should have Python already installed by default. 
Experienced users might wish to check out which version of Python they have by starting a Terminal and typing in: 
```python --version```
If you want to update or install a newer Python version (recommended only for users with Python 2.5) on a Linux system just start a Terminal and type:
```
sudo apt-get install python
```
Mac users should also use the Terminal to first install `homebrew` which is then used to download a new version of Python. To do so, type in the following commands:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
brew install python
```

Let's create a simple class book:
